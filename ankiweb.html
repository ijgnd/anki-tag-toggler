<b>This add-on wasn't tested much and might contain bugs. Use this at your own risk!</b>

This is an adaption of the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/874498171" rel="nofollow">Tag Toggler</a> to Anki version 2.1 by a different author. I made only very few changes.

See the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/874498171" rel="nofollow">original description</a>.

The configuration now uses the Anki add-on config dialog. There were slight changes to the config, check the readme on the side of the add-on config window.

<b># bugs</b>
Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug let me know on <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki-tag-toggler/issues" rel="nofollow">github</a> or via reddit (/u/ijgnord).
