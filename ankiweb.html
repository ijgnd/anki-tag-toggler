<b>Overview</b>

Tag Toggler is an add-on for Anki 2 that lets you quickly add and edit tags while reviewing.  You can customize keyboard shortcuts for editing all tags on the current card, as well as quickly adding, deleting, or toggling specific preset tags.  After applying the tags, you can optionally bury the card, bury the note, suspend the card, or suspend the note.

Applying a tag to a card applies the tags to all cards in that note, which is how Anki always handles tags.

Here are some ways that I use the add-on:
<ul>
<li> Toggle the 'hard' tag on the current card:
<code>    'Shift+H': {'tags': 'hard', 'action': 'toggle'}</code></li>
<li> Add a 'TODO' tag and bury cards in the current note:
<code>    'Shift+T': {'tags': 'TODO', 'after': 'bury-note'}</code></li>
<li> Add an 'easy' tag and suspend the current card:
<code>    'Shift+A': {'tags': 'easy', 'after': 'suspend-card'}</code></ul></li>
Customization is fairly straightforward, with instructions in the source code.

Tag Toggler was inspired by the Quick Tagging add-on by Cayenne Boyer.
